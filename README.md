# simpleAppsScriptDataWriter

The JavaScript file is a simple Google Apps Script WebApp to which you can send POST and GET requests to write data to spreadsheets within a given folder in your Google Drive. The Sheet is dynmaically selected by the HTTP request. If no such sheet exists, one is created first, then appended to with the data.

This project is not well polished, it's simply a quick snapshot of something that's working fine enough right now.
